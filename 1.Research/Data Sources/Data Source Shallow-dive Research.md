I need to determine what sources I want to ingest data from first. This can inform the kind of modelling I need to perform and other technical design choices I need to make.


| Source                                               | Ingestion Type | Types of Data                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/commons/api.php) | API            | Team compositions, player histories, competition formats, roster moves. |
